        <h2>Our Tree Surgeon Services</h2>

        <p>
          As a leading tree surgeon for Cork and greater WA, we offer a wide range of tree-related services. The following are amongst our areas of specialisation:
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><i>Tree Lopping / Pruning:</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Tree lopping is a critical aspect of long-term tree management, as it ensures that the tree remains healthy whilst taking on a shape and direction of growth that fits with the overall environment.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Tree Transplanting:</i></dt>
          <dd>
            Moving a tree from one location to another is a highly specialised task, and only a tree surgeon should be trusted to carry this out. Depending on the age and type of tree in question, we may be able to help you relocate it in order to avoid having to cut it down altogether.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Tree Removal:</i><dt>
          <dd>
            Sometimes, there is simply no alternative to having to remove a tree. If you find yourself in this position, we can assist with the felling of the tree as well as with the stump grinding. By the time the job is complete, no trace of the tree will remain.
          </dd>
          <dt><i>Tree Planting:</i></dt>
          <dd>
            We also offer tree sales in Cork, with a wide range of species and varieties on offer. Whether you’re completely overhauling the landscape of a property or simply looking to enhance an existing layout with a few extra plantings, Tree Surgeons of WA are standing by to help.
